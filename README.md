|In the highly competitive landscape of digital marketing, effectively evaluating the success of various marketing campaigns is essential for optimizing return on investment (ROI) and improving overall performance. Despite having extensive data on multiple campaigns, there is a need for a thorough analysis to assess and compare key metrics such as conversion rates, acquisition costs, and ROI across different campaign types, channels, and audience segments. This project aims to uncover actionable insights by examining temporal trends, geographical influences, and audience responses to identify factors driving campaign success and provide recommendations for enhancing future marketing strategies.|
